# coursera-datacleaning
## this is part of my work for "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project Coursera 2015

This file [README.md] explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

## CONTEXT
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Graded will be done by peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
This project contains : 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a Github repository with the script performing the analysis [run_analysis.R] and all files except original data, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
   or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
   
## SUBJECT
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing
see for example this article : 
http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/ 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced 
algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from 
the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Original data source for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
there is no need to download this file because when you run the script [run_analysis.R] 
it will download it for you and uncompress the zip file in the current directory under 
a folder named : data
